# About Me

I hold a Bachelor of Engineering degree from the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, conferred in June 2024. Currently, I am embarking on a Master's journey in Data Science and AI at Chalmers University of Technology, within the Department of Computer Science and Engineering.

My professional experience includes an internship at the Midea Group AI Innovation Center, where I contributed to the development of large language models (LLM) for consumer applications. Furthermore, I had the privilege of being a remote visiting student at the AI Lab, Westlake University, China, under the esteemed guidance of Chair Prof. Stan Z. Li (IEEE Fellow, IAPR Fellow, Chief Scientist of BioMap). There, I focused on leveraging AI for Life Science (e.g. AI + protein design, AI + enzyme engineering).

My academic and research interests encompass deep representation learning and generative model for out-of-distribution data, AI for scientific discovery (AI4Science), natural language processing (NLP), and graphical neural networks (GNN). I am passionate about advancing these fields through innovative research and practical applications.
